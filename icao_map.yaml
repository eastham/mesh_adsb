# Configuration file for mapping Meshtastic device IDs to ICAO addresses
#
# This file maps Meshtastic device IDs (format: !xxxxxxxx) to ICAO addresses
# for rendering in tar1090. Replace the example values below with your actual
# Meshtastic device IDs and desired ICAO addresses.
#
# ICAO Address Ranges:
# - You can use any ICAO address range that doesn't conflict with real aircraft
# - Example range: 0xADF800 - 0xADF8FF (256 addresses)
# - Configure your tar1090 instance to render these addresses with custom icons

"icao_start": ADF800          # Start of your reserved ICAO range
"icao_share_start": ADF814    # Start of range for IP-shared positions from remote instances
"icao_share_end": ADF8FF      # End of reserved range

# Device ID to ICAO mappings
# Format: "!<meshtastic_id>": <ICAO_address>  # optional comment with device name and N-number
"!abc12345": ADF800   # Example: Vehicle 1, N10CE
"!abc12346": ADF801   # Example: Vehicle 2, N10CF
"!abc12347": ADF802   # Example: Vehicle 3, N10CG
"!abc12348": ADF803   # Example: Vehicle 4, N10CH
"!abc12349": ADF804   # Example: Vehicle 5, N10CJ
"!abc1234a": ADF805   # Example: Vehicle 6, N10CK
"!abc1234b": ADF806   # Example: Vehicle 7, N10CL
"!abc1234c": ADF807   # Example: Vehicle 8, N10CM
"!abc1234d": ADF80A   # Example: Aircraft 1, N10CQ

# Human-readable names for ICAO addresses (used in logging)
# Format: '<ICAO_address>': "name"
